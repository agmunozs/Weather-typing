Welcome to PyWR's documentation!
================================

**PyWR** is a python library for calculating, exploring, and correcting weather types. Correction of weather types is done by use of procrustes analysis. The PyWR library also includes plotting functions which can be used to visualize weather types, compare them between model and reanalysis datasets, and view the procrustes decomposition.
