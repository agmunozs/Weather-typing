Welcome to PyWR's documentation!
================================

**PyWR** is a python library for calculating, exploring, and correcting weather types. 

Computation of weather types/regimes diagnostics using K-means. Model weather types are projected (or not) into the observed ones in the EOF space.

Weather type callibration and decomposition is done by use of procrustes analysis. 

The library also includes plotting functionality which can be used to visualize weather types, and view and compare procrustes callibration and decomposition.
